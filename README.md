# Kinematic-Solver

* free to use, just throw me a mention somwhere
* if you figure out a bug pls lmk
* default setup is for double wishbone... will upload a default for macpherson in the future hopefully
* See Naming_Convention for double wishbone points naming convention used in this script
* code should be somewhat commented... algorithm partially stolen from wikipedia
* approach taken from Spinning Thumbs on yt

## How to use
* just download kinsolve.py and main.py into the same folder
* run main.py and enjoy:)

## Known bugs
* weird stuff can be seen in the caster/camber/toe graphs when you set num_steps to anything between 25 and 100.
  * I dont know why this happens, and i probably won't fix it. just set it to a bigger or smaller value and it goes away
